<h1>Sample Task</h1>

<p>If we throw an iron axe into river, it sinks. We know that iron is a metal much heavier than water.
The same is for golden ring and even aluminium spoon - for even aluminium is too heavy, though
3 times lighter than iron.</p>

<p>Yet there are metals which may float in water because they are extremely light. Name three of them.</p>

<p><i>Three chemical symbols (e.g. 'Al', 'Fe', 'Au' for Aluminium, Iron and Gold) should be given,
separated by spaces.</i></p>
